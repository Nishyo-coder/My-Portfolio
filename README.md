# My-Portfolio
Nish Codes Now
## Description
Update: This new portfolio is under a new repo, still with a cleaner and more responsive application that my first go at my portfolio. The media responsiveness has been updated along with cleaning up the Navbar. 

Current Projects have also been updated: StoryBook Weddings and The README app. 

Future Development will include a sliding gallery of my projects.

The purpose was to use HTML and advanced CSS techniques, alternative frameworks and Javascript to build a responsive, mobile-friendly portfolio web app. 
- The motivation behind this starter website was to hopefully over time demonstrate my growth in coding.
- I built this starter website as a catalyst for my portfolio.
- I learned that many techniques can be used to create similar web applications. 
- Languages Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Frameworks: Bootstrap, UIKit, JQuery, Google Gonts
